# ForestLayer

ForestLayer is a scalable, fast deep forest learning library based on Scikit-learn and Ray.
It provides rich data processing, model training and serving modules to help researchers and engineers build practical deep forest learning workflows.
It internally embedded task parallelization mechanism using Ray, which is a popular flexible, high-performance distributed execution framework proposed by U.C.Berkeley.
